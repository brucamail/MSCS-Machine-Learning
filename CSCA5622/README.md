# CSCA 5622: Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning

The notebook was built using Google Colab with a repository from Kaggle, therefore I pulled the data directly from Kaggle using my credentials.

If you want to run this notebook, I also added the csv file in this directory so you can change the code and run it locally.

CSV file: Expanded_data_with_more_features.csv
